<h3>Sequences</h2>

A sequence defines a list of items that are together a sequence list.

<h3>Operations</h2>

Operations are a sequence that is executed on a list entry when building the list.

<h3>Actions</h2>

Actions operate on a sequence list after the list is build.

<h3>Ones</h2>

Executing a 'one' on a sequence will reduce the sequence to a single value.

<h3>Stores</h2>

Stores are stored sequence lists

<p>There are 5 PAD tags for Sequences

{table}{demo}

{sequence loop, from=10, to=20, name='mySeq'}

{/demo}{demo}

{operation add=4, mySeq} {$sequence} {/operation}

{/demo}{demo}

{store mySeq} {$sequence} {/store}

{/demo}{demo}

{action reverse, mySeq}  {$sequence} {/action}

{/demo}{demo}

{one average, mySeq} {$sequence} {/one}

{/demo}{/table}

<p>There are also 5 type definition for Sequences.

{table}{demo}

{sequence:loop from=10, to=20, name='mySeq'}

{/demo}{demo}

{operation:add 4, mySeq} {$sequence} {/operation:add}

{/demo}{demo}

{store:mySeq} {$sequence} {/store:mySeq}

{/demo}{demo}

{action:reverse mySeq} {$sequence} {/action:reverse}

{/demo}{demo}

{one:average mySeq}   {$sequence} {/one:average}

{/demo}{/table}

<p>Excect for operations sequence items can be used direct, however there are name colusons that force to use one of the 2 above constructs.

{table}{demo}

{loop from=10, to=20, name='mySeq'}

{/demo}{demo}

{mySeq} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}{demo}

{reverse mySeq} {$sequence} {/reverse}

{/demo}{demo}

{average mySeq} {$sequence} {/average}

{/demo}

{/table}


<p>A operation/action/one can be added as options to a sequence tag

{table}{demo}

{loop from=10, to=20, name='mySeq'}

{/demo}{demo}

{mySeq operation='even'} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}{demo}

{mySeq action='shuffle'} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}{demo} 

{mySeq one='max'} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}

{/table}

<p>A operation/action/one can be added as a parameter sequence tag (but naming conflicts are possible and then above option way must be used)

{table}{demo}

{loop from=10, to=20, name='mySeq'}

{/demo}{demo}

{mySeq even} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}{demo}

{mySeq shuffle} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}{demo} 

{mySeq average} {$sequence} {/mySeq}

{/demo}

{/table}
